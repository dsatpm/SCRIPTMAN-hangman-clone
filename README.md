# **Scriptman** - A Hangman clone

## Description

This is just a simple Hangman clone I created using mostly JavaScript. Click the 'Start Game' button to play through a round and use the keyboard to enter letters. If you guess correctly, your score will go up by 1.


## Usage

***Best ran on a full-screen***

I mean... it's Hangman. The game uses different JavaScript objects, variables, etc. as the possible solutions. Good luck!
