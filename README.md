# **Scriptman** - A Hangman clone

## Description

This is just a simple Hangman clone I created using mostly JavaScript. Click the 'Start Game' button to play through a round and use the keyboard to enter letters. If you guess correctly, your score will go up by 1.


## Usage

I mean... it's Hangman. The game uses different JavaScript objects, variables, etc. as the possible solutions. Good luck! 
***Best ran on a full-screen*** as the project is not yet responsive to varying viewport sizes.


## Support

You can find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/__dsatpm) with any questions or comments regarding this project.


## Contributions

This project was built by Jeremiah Haynes and Junior Solorio. Junior helped a ton figuring out the proper syntax for the 'keydown' events.


## Project Status

I will make this project responsive at a later time.
